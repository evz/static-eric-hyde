I&rsquo;ve written about my very limited exploits in exploring and leveraging 2010 census data in the past but this weekend I finally got back around to doing something about it. What I ended up with is looking like a pretty useful tool for anyone looking at projecting census data onto arbitrary geographies.

{% endmark %}

**A quick recap**

For those who didn&rsquo;t read the first [couple](/2011/10/2010-census-leveraging-whats-already-been-done.html) [posts](/2011/10/2010-census-getting-setup.html) I wrote about the reasoning behind why I&rsquo;m going through all this trouble in the first place, here&rsquo;s the story so far:

I work for the [Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; Faith](http://www.bahai.us). The administration of Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; communities across the continental United States is broken down into what we call Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; Localities. These can sometimes be mapped one-to-one onto an existing geography, such as a municipal boundary or a county but often times are combinations or subdivisions of those areas. Which makes the task of projecting census data onto them somewhat tricky. After I wrote about getting the census.ire.org Django project setup on my local VM, I got a Twitter shout out from [Joe Germuska](http://blog.germuska.com) over at the [Chicago Tribune](http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/) suggesting that I take a look at trying to build my shapes out of the basic kernel of all census shapes: the block. So, in case the title of this post doesn&rsquo;t give that away, that&rsquo;s what I did.

**Re-purposing guts of the IRE app**

Once I got the [census.ire.org project](https://github.com/ireapps/census) setup I kinda sat back at said to myself, &ldquo;uh, OK, now what&ellip;&rdquo;. My first approach was actually to forget about all the juicy goodness in there and try to just get what I needed from the API that they offer. Problem is, block level data is not available through the API (which I suppose is understandable given that there are like, 8,000,000 census blocks in the U.S.).

Since no one else had the data, it was starting to look like I would have to build it myself (\*gulp\*). In reading the docs for the IRE Django app, the parts that intrigued me the most were the parts that actually fetched census data and loaded it someplace. The someplace, in their case, was a MongoDB database which, at the end of the day, got dumped out and turned into flat JSONP files which were then uploaded to an S3 bucket so that schmoes like me could access it through the API. Problem with that, at least for me, was that I needed some way of comparing my arbitrary shapes with the census block shapes. What I needed, in a nutshell, was a [PostGIS](http://postgis.refractions.net/) database with both my arbitrary shapes and the census blocks. Luck for me, [I&rsquo;ve done that before](/2011/10/mapping-tools-101-a-few-things-ive-picked-up.html). 

So, what it came down to for me was to basically take what they were doing, rip out the MongoDB parts, put in PostGIS parts, and run some spatial lookups. Easy, right? Well, thanks to the work that was already done, yeah. But really, really boring.

**Before the boring part, the code**

OK, now we&rsquo;ll get into the meaty part where I show you what I did. My basic approach, like the IRE app, was to write a series of scripts which actually executed the various steps in the process. The real brains of what&rsquo;s going on is directly cribbed from the IRE app so I&rsquo;d literally be nowhere without them. If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing what they did before going any further, the hub round which everything else revolves is called batch_sf.sh and lives [here](https://github.com/ireapps/census/tree/master/dataprocessing).

The basic steps I came up with were slightly different than the ones that IRE uses because of a few things: all I wanted was block level data, I needed to know what area on the surface of the Earth the census data related to, and I didn&rsquo;t need to get all the census tables (I cherry picked 14 that seemed to be what I was after). The steps I followed, in order, are:

* Load the block level geospatial data into a PostGIS database
* Fetch the census data, generate the table headers and save it as CSV
* Create a cross reference table that facilitates a relation between the GIS data and the census data
* Load the block level census data into already prepared Django models for the 14 tables that I wanted
* Finally, make the spatial relations between my arbitrary geographies and census blocks

One word of caution before doing any of this stuff: working with block level data takes a huge amount of patience. When I got my batch script working, I ran it against Connecticut and it took 7 hours to complete. And that&rsquo;s one of the small states with only 67,000+ census blocks. Illinois has something like 450,000+ census blocks so the scale here gets pretty astronomical pretty fast. When I get the final wrinkles ironed out, the next phase will probably involve setting this stuff up on a cloud server, just letting it crank and then coming up with a way of serializing the output into something that I can use without ever having to run this stuff again until the 2020 census.

**Load GIS data**

This was actually remarkably simple thanks to the [GeoDjango LayerMapping tool](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/contrib/gis/layermapping/ "GeoDjango LayerMapping"). All it took was getting the data from [here](http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2010/TABBLOCK/2010/ "Block level GIS data") and stuffing it into a Django model. Here&rsquo;s the model I went with:
