**Updated 10/7/2012** I’ve actually gone ahead and put this site up on S3, which was only sorta possible a year ago when I first put it together (amazing how these things change so rapidly). Thanks to the S3 recently adding [the ability to do redirects](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html), I’ve also simplified the path structure and made it less Wordpress-y (which was really bugging me). I’ve left all the stuff down below just for historic purposes and so that I can make fun of my year-ago self.

So, what you’re looking at is the result of a weekend hack project inspired by [this post](http://www.nata2.org/2011/01/26/how-to-use-app-engine-to-host-static-sites-for-free/ "OMG FREE HOSTING: How to use GAE to host static sites for free") by Harper Reed back in January 2011. It outlines how he figured out how to leverage Google’s AppEngine to host his static sites for free using [DryDrop](http://drydrop.binaryage.com/ "DryDrop: Update AppEngine site by pushing to Github"). For some reason, after reading that, I kinda said, “huh, that’s neat”, and never really did anything about it. Until, early on the morning of October 22, I suddenly had the urge to write about some of the hacking projects I was working on but, other than paying for a domain, I didn’t want to bother with the nitty-gritty of managing any kind of hosted site.

So, I downloaded DryDrop, setup a [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/ "Vagrant") VM, and got to work. What you’re reading and looking at is the result. A static site that is updated by pushing content into this [github repo](https://github.com/evz/static-eric "Eric on github"). I managed to get comments going though [Disqus](http://disqus.com/ "Disqus") and figured that any other “interactive” elements can be easily wired in with a bit of Javascript magic. The only thing that I’m missing at the moment is some kind of search mechanism but considering there’s not much here at the moment, there’s not much need. At any rate, I’m looking at using something like [this](http://tapirgo.com/ "Tapir search") down the road. If you’re interested in how I accomplished this, [here’s a post](/2011/10/omg-free-hosting-an-homage-to-harper-reed.html "OMG FREE HOSTING: An homage to Harper Reed") I wrote after setting it up.

Anyways, it’s not an original concept but I thought it was a pretty nice weekend hack project and maybe I’ll even start polluting the internet with some of my Python/Django/whatever musings in the coming months.
