<p>My introduction to Python, and Django in particular, was a week-long project to setup, from scratch, a basic, working GeoDjango project. Thanks to some really <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/contrib/gis/">stellar documentation</a>, which has actually improved quite a bit since back in the day (like, a year and a half ago or whatever), I was able to do it. But, quite frankly, that was only the beginning. When I showed off my little application around the office, it ended up being a full fledged project, which I&rsquo;m still tweaking to this day. This is an attempt to unravel some of what I&rsquo;ve picked up during that time, especially given all of the recent developments in the web based mapping sphere. This is by no means a comprehensive overview, but rather just a guy sharing how he does what he&nbsp;does.</p>

<p>One of the challenges I identified early one when <a href="omg-free-hosting-an-homage-to-harper-reed.html">setting up this site</a> was that it was going to be a bit tricky to get some kind of search tool working for it. When I Googled it, I was pretty excited to find <a href="http://tapirgo.com/">this tool</a> but when I sat down yesterday to implement it, it was broke. And by broke, I mean it wasn&rsquo;t returning any results and the developers weren&rsquo;t responding to any attempts at communications. So, I figured, if they can parse my <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed and turn it into something that returns search results, so can I. What follows is how I managed to get that&nbsp;going.</p>

<p>After attending <a href="http://meetupchicago.hackshackers.com/events/36413602/?eventId=36413602&amp;amp;action=detail">this meetup</a> last week, I was pretty excited to get going on hacking census data for <a href="2010-census-leveraging-whats-already-been-done.html">my own purposes</a>. I had the day off on Thursday so I spent most of the day trying to get the <a href="http://census.ire.org/">census.ire.org</a> source <a href="https://github.com/ireapps/census">code</a> running in a local <span class="caps">VM</span>. Despite being one of those guys that&rsquo;s pretty good at following directions, I did run into a few problems (but, then again, I&rsquo;m not much of a sysadmin). In the spirit of maybe making someone&rsquo;s life easier, here&rsquo;s how I got the project going in a Ubuntu 11.04 <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">vagrant <span class="caps">VM</span></a>.</p>

<p>Part of what I do at work is make maps. To me, the best maps are those that show you, at a glance, something interesting about what&rsquo;s going on around you, and, if you&rsquo;re curious, allow you to explore what&rsquo;s going on in the rest of the world. I&rsquo;ve been following what the <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/">Tribapps</a> team has been doing with the 2010 census data as it has been coming out and after going to a recent <a href="http://meetupchicago.hackshackers.com/events/36413602/?eventId=36413602&amp;amp;action=detail">Hacks/Hackers Meetup</a> where <a href="http://blog.germuska.com/">Joe Germuska</a> presented some of the APIs that they&rsquo;ve been working on and I gotta say, I was inspired. Below are some preliminary steps and&nbsp;observations.</p>

<p>Back in January, I read <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2011/01/26/how-to-use-app-engine-to-host-static-sites-for-free/">this</a> and thought it was a pretty cool idea. For some reason, I just kinda filed it away and didn&rsquo;t really think about it until sometime in the early morning hours of October 22 when I got the urge to write about <a href="2010-census-leveraging-whats-already-been-done.html">this</a> but didn&rsquo;t really have anywhere to do it. Add to that the fact that I my brain starts hurting when I start to see the long road of configuring and deploying a site, whatever the platform. I just wanted something that would kinda be there, look presentable out of the box, and not have anything to do with&nbsp;<span class="caps">PHP</span>. </p>
